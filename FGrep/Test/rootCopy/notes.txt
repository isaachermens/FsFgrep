Ch. 3: The Law of Demand 1/9/13
	Demand curve: downward sloping curve
	A change in quantity demanded = up or down the demand curve
		Results only due to changes in price
	Changes in demand result in shifts of the demand curve to the left of right
		Results from changes in: income, preferences, prices of related goods, number of buyers, expectations of future price
	Related Goods: complementary & substitute goods
		Demand for complementary goods increases and decreases together (directly related)
		Demand for substitute goods are inversely related
			Virtually every product sold in America has many substitutes, results in downward competitive pressure and improves standard of living

Ch. 4: Price Ceilings & Floors 1/9/13
	Price ceiings
		Only effective when placed below the equilibrium price
		Results in shortages; usually damaging for all members of the economy
			Less profit for producers and additional non-financial costs for consumers.
	Price floors
		Only effective when placed above the equilibrium price
		Results in surpluses; can be damaging to the economy
		
Ch. 20: Elasticity 1/11/13
	Price is among the primary tools that businesses have to maximize revenue
	Elasticity is a quantification of how responsive individuals are to changes in price.
	TV shopping advertisements often measure elasticity by observing consumers' reactions when prices are altered during a long commercial
	The elasticity coefficient, or price elasticity of demand, is found by the midpoint formula
			(change in quantity demanded / average quantity demanded) / (change in price / average price)
			If a change in price from 10 to 12 resulted in a change in demand from 50 to 100, the formula would be:
				(50 / 75) / (2 / 11)
			Given an elasticity coefficient of 2, a 1% increase in price results in a 2% decrease in quantity demanded
			Terms:
				Inelastic: quantity demanded changes less than price (E < 1)
				Elastic: quantity demanded changes more than price (E > 1)
				Perfectly inelastic: Quantity demanded does not change as price changes (E ~= 0)
				Perfectly elastic: Quantity demanded is extremely responsive to even small changes in price (E -> infinity)
				Unit elastic: quantity demanded and price change at the same rate (E = 1) (uncommon in real world)
			The flatter the demand curve, the more elastic the market (E increases with a decrease in slope)
			Conversely, the steeper the demand curve, the less elastic the market (E decreases with an increase in slope)
				A flat curve is perfectly elastic
				A vertical curve is perfectly inelastic
			Business decisions:
				Price is the only factor over which businesses have complete control
				Larger the elasticity coefficents result in a more competitive market and more price cutting
					Cutting prices increases revenue
					Note: higher elasticity coefficients usually mean a higher standard of living
				Small elasticity coefficients cause companies to push prices as high as they believe they can get away with
					Selling less product at higher prices results in higher revenue
			Unit elasticity sometimes occurs in the textbook market
			Agricultural products are close to perfect elasticity
			The market for utilities (running water, electricity, etc) are perfectly inelastic
			The market for illegal drugs is quite inelastic (users are addicted)
				Drug busts/laws decrease the supply, thereby increasing the price demanded and increasing drug-related crimes
	Price elasticity of demand along a straight line demand curve:
		Mathematical bias at extreme ends of the demand curve
			Along the high price, low quantity demanded end of the curve, a mathematical bias causes the elasticity coefficient to be large
			Along the low price, high q.d. end of the curve, the same bias results in a low coefficient
			Total revenue is maximized somewhere around the middle of the curve in most cases
			This bias an be offset by a behavioral bias:
				Airlines use small quantities of highly priced aluminum components (mathematically elastic bias, behaviorally inelastic)
				Housewives use large quantities of inexpensive aluminum foil (mathematically inelastic, behaviorally elastic)
	Why demand is elastic:
		Sellers charge people different prices
		This is due to substitutes
			"If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, don't marry a pretty wife"; a pretty woman has more substitutes for you
				and will place higher demands upon you, while a homely woman has fewer substitutes for you and will place fewer demands 
			Businesses base their pricing on how many substitutes their customers have:
				The travel industry charges business travellers more than tourists
				Mechanics often charge women more
Ch. 20 Part II 1/14/13
	Determinants of price elasticity of demand:
		Number of substitutes:
			The more substitute products exist for your product, the higher its elasticity
			Fewer substitutes -> lower elasticity
			No direct control over your competitor's, but businesses attempt to provide unique features & convince consumers of their superiority
			Consoles (Xbox, PS3, etc) are sold relatively cheaply in order to lock customers in to buying games for that console
			Up front fees (monetary or otherwise) are designed to increase the cost of switching to a subsequent product/fee
				Makes your product less elastic, allowing you to raise your prices.
			The more specificially defined a product is, the more substitutes it has
				More substitutes exist for a Ford Mustang than for cars in general.
		Necessitites vs. Luxuries
			Luxeries have a higher degree of elasticity
				Easier to substitute for
				Easier to live without (not needed to continue life)
		% of consumer budget spent on good
			Higher relative price -> higher elasticity
			Products on which a consumer spends 10% of their budget demonstrate higher elasticity than products on which they spend 0.1%
		Time
			Elasticity will be higher in the long run than in the short term
				Opportunity to change purchasing patterns, alter habits, find substitutes, etc.
			Example: oil companies spike their prices and decrease them after some time has passed to remove the incentive for 
				customers to purchase more efficient vehicles
	Other elasticity concepts:
		Cross elasticity of demand:
			Measures how strongly an item is perceived as a substitute or complement for another
			Ec = (% change in quantity demanded of one good) / (% change in price of another good)
			Example: (% change in quantity demanded of Skippy) / (% change in price of Jif)
			Ec < 0 -> The goods are complements (decrease in quantity demanded for one decreases demand for other)
			Ec > 0 -> The goods are substitutes (decraese in quantity demanded for one increases demand for other)
		Income elasticity of demand:
			(% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in income)
			Increase in income increases purchases of normal goods and decreases purchases of inferior goods
			Decrease in income decreases purchases of normal goods and increases purchases of inferior goods
			Poor countries have higher income of elasticity of food than wealthy countries.
		Price elasticity of supply:
			(change in quantity supplied / average quantity supplied) / (change in price / average price)
			In a service & information based ecomony, supply is driven by demand and this measurement is less significant than the others
	Taxes and Elasticity
		Who pays the tax?
			With a downward sloping demand curve and an upward sloping supply curve, the business and its consumers each pay a portion
			of the tax.
			If demand for a product is highly elastic (flat), business bears more of the tax burden
			For a highly inelastic product, consumers pay a higher percentage of the tax.
			In an elastic market, businesses lose a portion of their pricing power and have less ability to pass expensive to customers
				It's difficult to tax powerful corporations without most of the burden landing on their customers.
Ch. 21: Utility & Behavioral Economics 1/16/2013 & 1/18/2013
	How do people make decisions with regard to purchasing products?
	Utility is a measure of the satisfaction or benefit that results from the purchase of a good
		Not really possible to measure, but how people assign it can be observed
		As you consume more successive units of a product, marginal utility decreases
		Cumulative total utility increases at a decreasing rate
		Law of Marginal Utility:
			Decreasing marginal utility causes consumers to stop purchasing a good once the ratio of marginal utility to price is insufficient
				Can tell this is happening when you begin to debate purchases
			Pricing strategies differ depending on whether or not consumers are able to stock up on a good or not(delayed utiity)
			Marginal utility also depends on the use of the good
				We use goods for their most valued purpose first, then address incrementally less necessary purposes.
			The Law IS NOT a means for interpersonal utility comparisons (can't use it to compare between multiple individuals)
			We look mainly at marginal utility when purchasing things or allocating our times
		There are exceptions to the rule:
			You get more utility from the 4th car you put on your car than the first 3
		When our behaviors go too far, marginal utility can obtain negative values
	The Diamond-Water Paradox:
		Diamond's have high marginal utility but relatively low total utility
		Water has low marginal utility but high total utility
	Consumer Equilibrium & Demand
		Consumer equilibrium is the point at which we maximize our total utility in terms of our scarce resources
	Should the government provide the necessities of life freely?
		Marginal utility dropping below price serves as a signal to stop consuming
		If price were removed, people would consume past the point of efficiency and be inefficient
		When financial cost is removed, it is replaced by other costs
	Increased prices reallocate goods/resources to those who really need/want the product.
	
	There are some assumptions that people will behave rationally
		This is often an unrealistic belief
	Indifference curves: (not on test)
		Consumers are willing to give up a larger quantity of a good that they are saturated with.
		Maximize enjoyment from consumption of goods by finding the intersection of the budget constraint curve and the indifference curve
	
Ch. 22: Production & Costs 1/23/13
	Invisible hand vs. visible hand
		"Individuals in a market are led by an invisible hand to promote an outcome that was not their intention" - Adam Smith
	Why do firms exist?
		One theory, created by Alchian and Demsetz, is that people unite into firms in order to increase efficiency & productivity
			Also leads to difficulties, such as shirking
				The larger the group, the less harm the individual suffers as a result of shirking
				Personnel, such as managers or monitors, must be added to promote efficient production.
		Ronald Coase believed that firms exist to minimize the number of transactions that must occur & reduce their cost
	Accounting side of things:
		Profit = revenue - total cost
		Owner's equity + investment - withdrawals + revenue - expenses = owner's equity (accounting formula)
			Owner's equity = assets - liability
			We mostly care about revenue and expenses, manager's have the most influence over these 2 factors
		Two ways to maximize revenue, depending on elasticity
			Inelastic demand: high price, low quantity
			Elastic demand: low price, high quantity
		Explicit costs = hard, financial costs. Things that you would write a check for, etc.
		Implicit costs = the opportunity cost of running your business. If you give up a job as a lawyer to start a restaraunt, your lawyer's salary = implicit cost
		AccountingProfit = TotalRevenue - ExplicitCosts
		EconomicProfit = TotalRevenue - (ExplicitCosts - ImplicitCosts)
			Normal profit occurs when economic profit is 0
			Economic profit usually gravitates towards 0
	Inputs
		Fixed inputs are inputs that cannot be changed as production increases
		Variable inputs can be changed as output changes
		"Short run" refers to a period of time in which at least 1 input is fixed
		"Long run" refers to a period of time in which no inputs are fixed
	Production (short run):
		Marginal Physical Product (MPP): the change in physical product produced by increasing variable inputs
			first rises at an increasing rate (economies of scale)
			then maximizes (what is the term for this? constent economies of scale?)
			then continues rising at a decreasing rate, can also decrease (diseconomies of scale)
		Average fixed costs dwindles to an insignificant amount at very high inputs
			TFC is fixed so AFC decreases as output increases
		Total variable cost increases as output increases
			AVC is parabollic in shape (small slope)
		Marginal cost curve is parabollic (small slope)
		Marginal cost curve intersects with the AVC and ATC curves at their lowest points
			Average-marginal rule: marginal cost curve pulls the AVC curve up or down
	Sunk Cost:
		A cost incurred in the past by a previous decision that cannot be recovered
		According to economists, sunk costs should be ignored when making decisions
		Ex. buying a movie ticket and finding out that you don't like the movie; you can't recover the sunk cost of the ticket
	Production (long run):	
		When SRATC begins to increase:
			Expand fixed inputs, creating a new SRATC curve and pushing ATC down
			OR
			increase prices to keep ATC at a low point on the LRATC curve
		Minimum efficient scale: lowest quantity minimum point on the LRATC
		Federal Express did a very good job of balancing expansion & revenue by leasing airplanes while volumes were volatile
			Once volume stabilized, they purchased the airplanes they had been leasing

Ch. 23: Perfect Competition: 2/1/2013
	Built on 4 assumptions:
		There are many sellers and many buyers, none of which is large in comparison to the total
		Sellers produce and sell a homogeneous product
		Buyers and sellers have all relavent information regarding prices, quantities, quality, etc.
		There is easy entry into and exit out of the market
	Agriculture is one of the best examples
		There are a huge number of farmers and many people who want food.
		Relatively easy entry and exit when compared to many other industries
		Farmers compete by pushing for greater efficiency/productivity rather than trying to control market share
	Perfectly competitive firms are price takers
		They have no individual ability to affect the market price
		Market supply and demand curves are standard
		Single firm demand curve is perfectly elastic
		Businesses don't like being price takers - they lose their only element of control over their pricing structure
		Perfect competition tends to cause firms to compete internally instead of with each other -- support each other
		Firms seek to escape from perfect competition
			The most common method is to break assumption number 2 by differentiating their product from their competitors'
	Marginal Revenue
		Marginal revenue is synonymous with the demand curve in a perfectly competitive market
	Quantity of Output
		Firms will increase output until marginal revenue == marginal cost
		Profit maximization (per unit) occurs at the low point of the marginal cost curve
		Absolute profit maximization occurs when MC=MR=P
		Managers are typically evaluated based on total profit, not unit profit
		When firms increase efficiency to increase output, it increases market supply thereby pushing price DOWN
			This is why the government subsidizes agricultural products
	Profit Maximization/Loss Minimization
		If a firm is making a positive economic profit (P > ATC) at its maximum profit, 
			other firms will be attracted to the market, pushing price down due to increased supply and returning economic profit to 0
		If average variable cost will is > price, the firm will shut down in the short run
		If P > ATC, firm will continue to produce in the short run
		If P < ATC and P > AVC, the firm will continue to produce in the short run
	Supply Curve
		The marginal cost curve is the same as the individual supply curve
	Perfect Competition in the Long Run
		Economic Profit = 0
		Firms are producing the quantity of output at which MC=MR=P
		No firm has incentive to change its plant size to alter output
			P=MC=SRATC=LRATC
		Changes in demand temporarily increase price until more firms join the market:
			In decreasing cost industry, final price will be lower than starting price
			In constant cost industry, final price will be equal to starting price
			In increasing cost industry, final price will be higher than starting price
		Higher opportunity costs can off set higher profit.

Ch. 24: Monopoly (2/8/2013)
	Monopoly is the exact opposite of perfect competition:
		A single produces controls the entire market
		Business want to move towards monopoly, but
			the government wants to prevent businesses from monopolizing and keep them closer to perfect competition.
				Liberals care more about keeping businesses away from monopolies
	Assumptions of monopoly:
		A single seller
		That seller produces a unique product
		High barriers to entry in the market
	Postal Service has a legal monopoly on first class mail, but they cannot set their prices without permission from the government
	Governments allow utility companies to hold a natural monopoly because removing competition allows for extreme economies 
		of scale to exist for the monopolistic firm
	Exclusive ownership of a necessary resource:
		ALCOA (Aluminum Company of America) at one point was the sole producer of aluminum in the U.S.
		They owned nearly all boxite sources in the country, and therefore controlled the aluminum market
	Government monopoly vs. market monopoly
		Government monopoly has legal protection from the government
	
	Monopolists are price searchers
		Pricing still demands strategy in a monopoly
		Cutting prices increases quantity demandeds
		Monopolies usually have extremely high fixed costs
	For a monopolist, the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve
		Start at the same point, MR falls behind Demand is quantity increases
	The Profit Maximizing Price lies at the quantity where MR=MC
		P>MC at that point
	
	Once an artist/writer etc. has completed a product, their MC for units sold is 0.
		They also receive royalties as a percentage of total revenue
	However, their publishing company has MC>0.
	The artist would like prices to be lower so that more copies sell, but the publisher does not.
	
	Monopoly, Perfect Competition, & Consumer Surplus
		In perfect competition, the quantity is produced where MC=P=MR
		In monopoly, the (smaller) quantity is produced where MR=MR < P
		Lower quantities are produced in a monopoly
	Monopoly or nothing:
		In some markets with high fixed costs and/or small numbers of consumers, a monopoly is the only financially viable option
		If a monopoly does not exist, no producer will exist in the market
	The Case Against Monopoly:
		Deadweight Loss:
			Monopoly produces fewer goods at higher prices than does perfect competition
			The deadweight loss triangle is the area under the Demand curve and do the right of the monopoly quantity of production
		Rent Seeking:
			Firms seeking a monopoly spend a great deal of resources attempting to gain and maintain their monopoly
				Political lobbies, campaign contributions, etc.
			Individually intelligent, socially wasteful.
	
	Price Discrimination:
		Allows monopolistic firms to increase profits by increasing marginal revenue
		Gives a firm greater control over price
		When lowering prices, you only lower prices for individuals for whom a drop in price will increase consumption
		In order to discriminate, a firm must:
			Be a price searcher
			Be able to differentiate among customers
			Be able to prevent arbitrage (buying at a certain price and reselling for a higher price)
		Three types of price discrimination:
			Perfect Price Discrimination (unit discrimination): Charge each consumer the maximum price they're willing to pay
				P=MC=MR
			Second degree discrimination (discrimination by quantity): Charge lower prices for higher quantities (& vice versa)
				Marginal revenue pulls closer to price
			Third degree discrimination (discrimination among markets/customers): Alternating price according to what the market is
				Marginal revenue pulls closer to price
				People with more free time are willing to clip coupons
				Senior citizens and college students often receive decreased price rates

Ch. 25: Monopolistic Competition, Market Competition, & Oligopoly
	Monopolistic Competition:
		Assumptions:
			Many sellers and buyers
			Each firm sells a slightly differentiated product (only difference between monopolistic and perfect competition)
			Easy entry to and exit from the market
		It is possible for a firm to have a positive economic profit, but that condition is unlikely to persist
			Positive economic profit attracts other firms to the market
			Each additional firm that enters the market causes other firms' demand curves to shift to the left
		Differentiating a product almost always increases the cost of production
			Also decreases size of target market
			Most firms attempt to produce a product that is just slightly differentiated from competition
		Excess capacity:
			Forms in monopolistic competition produce a quantity of output at which they do not minimize ATC
				Demand curve insersects ATC curve at a point other than the minimum
			Part of their manufacturing potential is not utilized
		The primary way to increase profit in monopolistic competition is to identify why customers like your product and advertise
			to shift the demand curve to the right, not cutting price
			
	Oligopoly:
		Assumptions:
			Significant barriers to entry and exit
			Several sellers and many buyers. 
			Product can be either homogenous or differentiated. 
			All firms are independent upon one another; each firm's actions affect the others 
		4 and 8 firm concentration ratios: the percentage of the market controlled by the 4 or 8 largest firms
			Government monitors concentration ratios to watch for oligopolies approaching monopoly. 
		Cartel Theory: group of companies makes an agreement to operate as a single unit. 
			Becomes similar to a monopoly and allows all firms to earn economic profits instead of normal profits. 
			Often works best if your product is a scarce natural resource. 
			These agreements are often extremely difficult to forge and maintain. Companies or countries rarely have identical desires and will willingly stab each other in the back. 
		Prisoner's Dilemma: how will people behave when placed in a situation where their choices effect both themselves and another person (and vice versa)? 
			In general, people (and firms) will usually make the choice that, in a vacuum, is the best for themselves 
		Cartels will produce the quantity that minimizes marginal cost, thereby creating economic profit. 
		A single cheater can produce a much greater quantity while still selling at the cartel price, greatly increasing their profits. 
			If one cheats, they make a lot of money, if they all cheat, no one makes any profit. 
		Cartels adjust price to alter and exploit market demand.
	
Ch. 26: Government Regulation & Restrictions. February 22, 2013
Pertains largely to oligopolies moving towards monopoly 
	Businesses like monopoly, government likes perfect competition 
How concentrated should government allow a market to become 
	Traditionally, Republicans have been more friendly to big business than Democrats 
Recently, Democrats have been conflicted because they like strong labor unions, which are often linked to the strength of large firms 
Republicans have the opposite conflict 
Two different viewpoints:
	Against concentration: results in inefficient resource allocation, is not necessary in most cases due to the size of the market
	  (more and more true as we have become a global economy since a smaller percentage of the market place ), industrial concentration 
	  contributes to income inequality, economic power leads to political clout
	In favor of concentration: companies come to dominate because they sell a superior product or service, composition may be 
	  underestimated (substitutes that aren't classified identically), if we don't allow U.S. Companies can't compete with foreign 
	  companies, large size promotes new technology development (R&D) 
	With the threat of outsourcing, breaking up powerful firms can result in job loss to foreign countries 
Anti-trust regularation has been relatively weak in recent years (despite Democratic government) due to the threat of foreign competition
Legislation:
	The Sherman Act (1890) contained 2 primary clauses; it was very vague and is typically considered to be too general to be of any use
	The Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act were attempts to give the Sherman Act teeth and focus on specific, enforceable things
		Price discrimination when price difference is not related to a change in costs (not done away with)
		Exclusive dealing (requiring retailers to not carry any substitutes for your product)
		Tying contract - making the price of one product tied to the purchase of another product
		Acquisition of competing company's stock, if such acquisition reduces competition
		Interlocking {something} - One person sitting on the board of directors for multiple companies
	Robinson-Pattman Act - The chain store act
		Illegal for businesses to offer discounts to chain stores (significant issue in the 1930s)
		Didn't really make much of a difference, because it's still perfectly acceptable to price discriminite via quantity.
	Other acts tightened up merger laws and legislated false advertising
Broad vs. Specific Market:
	ALCOA was legislated because their market was defined specifically as aluminum (instead of metals)
	Dupont escaped legislation because their market was defined as flexible wrapping materials instead of cellophane
	McKee Foods used to be McKee Baking Company; they changed names and expanded production to shift to a smaller share of overall market
Herfindahl Index:
	Square the percent market square of each firm and find the sum
		ex. 15^2+13^2+10^2+6^2
	How do they use it?
		< 1000 means that the market is typically unconcentrated and they won't bother it
		1000 < x < 1800 means that the market is moderately concentrated; contest merger is it would raise index by more than 100
		> 1800 means the the market is concentrated; challenge if index is raised by more than 50-100 points by the merger
		Note: challenge does not mean block.
		All firms with less than 1% market share are grouped together
		Herfindahl index is usually applied to concentrated markets
Horizontal vs Vertical Mergor
	A horizontal merger occurs when two firms in the same market merge (aka Ford merging with General Motors)
	A vertical merger occurs between firms in different stages of the manufacturing process (ex. Ford and Goodyear tire company)

Ch. 27: Factor Markets: Emphasis on the Labor Market. March 11, 2013
	Factor markets have become much more difficult to understand as our economy has shifted to be service and information based.
		For example, how many flight attendants should be placed on each airline?
		Microsoft releases a new major software product, how many tech support people should they hire?
		How many tellers/cashiers should a bank or store supply?
		Difficult to determine the balance between cost and revenue of labor.
	Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)
		The additional revenue generated by employing an additional factor unit
		Method 1: MRP = (delta)TR/(delta)Quantity of the Factor
		Method 2: MR * MPP 	(Marginal Revenue * Marginal Physical Product)
		MRP Curve = Factor Demand Curve, downward sloping curve (corresponds to product demand curve)
		MRP can become negative.
		Very difficult to determine the optimum amount of labor to purchase.
	Value Marginal Product
		VMP = P * MPP
		Just like MRP, the VMP curve is downward sloping.
		In perfect competition, VMP = MRP
			Since MR = Price
		In all non-perfect markets, VMP > MRP
			Since MR < Price
	Price Searchers vs. Price Takers
		Since most businesses are not in perfect competition, most firms are product price searchers (product price takers are the exception)
		However, most firms are factor price takers (factor price searchers are the exception)
			Wal-Mart has hired thousands upon thousands of workers without driving up the cost of labor.
			Factor price searchers usually only exist when the firm has a massive demand for labor in one small location - drives demand for labor up.
			This is part of the reason for dispersed labor demand
		Marginal Factor Cost (MFC) curve for a single firm is almost always a flat line.
			market MFC curve is upward sloping (this means that it is upward sloping for a monopsonist)
	Equating MRP and MFC
		Firm will continue hiring labor until the MRP curve falls below the MFC curve
	Businesses maximize utility from various factors by equalizing the MRP of multiple factors. (Least cost rule)
	Movement regarding the MRP curve
		If the cost of the factor changes, we move up or down the current curve
		Any other changes causes a SHIFT of the curve
		Shifts increase the quantity of labor, but do not increase wages, since nearly all firms are factor price takers.
	Elastificy of demand for labor
		Labor elasticify is directly related to product elasticify of demand
		If labor cost is a small percentage of total cost, labor will be more inelastic (and vice versa)
		The more substitutes available for a factor, the higher will be the factor's elasticity
		Sensitivity to the cost of a factor increases elasticity
			Elasticity increases if labor can be outsourced
	Market supply of Labor:
		Upward sloping supply curve - more labor available at higher wage rates.
	Wage Rate Equalization Across Labor Markets
		Across comparable markets, workers will move to higher pay rate market, causing rightward supply shift there and leftward supply curve shift in lower-pay market
			Stops when wages equalize
	Assumptions regarding labor
		Nonpecuniary (wage) aspects of labor
		Demand for all types of labor is the same
		Labor can relocate at no cost
		No cost to train new labor
	Marginal Productivity Theory: Firms in competitive factor markets pay factors their marginal revenue product
	
Ch. 28: Labor Unions & Their Effect on the Labor Market (3/18/13)
	Labor Unions pursue 1 of 3 goals:
		Employment of all members
			Must usually accept low wages in order to achieve complete employment.
		Maximizing total wage bill
			Wage bill = total amount of money coming from firm to employees
			Occurs in the middle of the labor demand curve
		Maximizing wages to some of the union membors
			Low total employment, but high wages.
		Some economists claim that unions' actual goal is to maximize their revenue from membership dues.
	The wage-employment tradeoff
		Usually, any increase in labor quantity results in a decrease in wages (and vice versa)
		If demand for labor is inelastic, the gain in employment outweighs the loss in wages
		If demand for labor is elastic, the gain in employment is outweighed by the loss in wages
	Manufacturing has long been a union stronghold
		Shift to service & information has weakened this hold
		Many manufacturing jobs have outsourced to find cheap labor, especially when unions pushed wages in the U.S. too high
			Foreign labor is a substitute for local labor and increases elasticity
			Huge capital investments make it much more difficult for firms to outsource, so not all manufacturing industries are equal in this regard
	Striking
		Unions have more leverage if substitutes for their labor are not available
		Unions have more leverage if their strike threatens contract dates or deadlines (puts extra pressure on the company)
	Labor Unions attempt to influence the elasticity of demand for labor (want to make inelastic)
		Attempt to limit availability of substitute goods
			Produced by non-union, often foreign, labor
			Unions have very little power if they cannot affect the supply of labor.
		Attempt to limit availability of substitute factors
			If a strike is the result of economic demands (more money), the firm can replace it's union labor with non-union labors
			Unions obviously don't like this
			Unions are currently hesitant to strike for more money because of high unemployment (lots of available labor for the firm) and outsourcing.
			Increasing prices of substitute factors
				Increase minimum wage (nonunion labor is often paid minimum wage)
		Attempt to increase demand for union labor
			Increase product demand through the use of union labels on products, etc.
			Closed Shop: firms must higher only union members
				Illegal in the united states
			Union Shop: firms must require employees to join union within a certain time period after being hired
				Exists in non-right to work states
			Open shop: no requirements for union memberships
				Right to work states
			Many firms refuse to open plants in non-right to work states
				McKee Foods is an example
		Collective bargaining: unions negotiate with firms on the behalf of all of their union members
		How do unions view themselves?
			A monopsony is a single buyer in a factor market (buyer version of monopoly)
			Just like monopolists have to lower price to sell more of a product, a monopsony must raise the amount that they pay in order to purchase more of a factor
				Factor price searcher
				MFC curve lies above supply curve
			Monopsonists buy the quantity of labor at which MFC = MRP and pay the wage rate corrosponding to that point on the supply curve, rather than the MRP curve
				Labor unions claim that the monopsonist is exploiting workers by paying them less than their MRP
				The union gives the firm a  flat supply curve
					Increased wages for workers
					MFC = S'
					Firm will purchase a higher quantity of labor (until MFC = S' = MRP)
	The effect of unions on wages:
		Unions typically increrase wages for union employees and decrease wages for nonunion labor
			Increase in union wages reduces number of employees hired in union sector, which increases the supply of labor to the nonunion sector

The Distribution of Income & Poverty (March 22 2013)
	The most controversial topic in this area is the redistribution of income through progressive taxation and social welfare programs.
		Opposition (typically conservative):
			Freedom of contract - the ability to sell labor and receive some financial reward, government takes some of that away to distribute to others
			Freedom of property - Government confiscates financial property to give it to others, diminishes  the incentive to invest in that property is diminished
			Welfare/Transfer programs interfere with the incentives provided by the market
				This effects both givers and receivers
	Who are the rich & poor?
		Divide all households into quintiles by income
		Top quintiles is 'rich'
		Bottom quintiles is 'poor'
		US has strong upward income mobility
			Availability of education plays a major role
		Income increases with age (until late in life)
		Households headed by people under 25 are more likely to have low income
		Usually, the more education there is in an economy, the more income inequality exists
	Government as Robin Hood
		Government takes from the rich and gives to the poor
			These transfer payments usually have strings attached (can only be used for specific things, etc)
		Theory: transfers benefit the poor more than they hurt the rich
			Results in overall gain of utility in the economy
				However, the conditions that the government places on its transfer payments decrease their utility
			This relies upon the (not strongly supported) idea of interpersonal utility comparisons
	A Simple Equation:
		Individual income = labor income + asset income + transfer payments - taxes
			Labor income is equal to the wage rate an individual receives multiplied by the number of hours worked
			Asset income consists of such things as the return on savings, the return to capital investment, and the return to land
			Transfer payments are payments to persons that are not made in return for goods and services provided (social security, welfare assistance)
			Finally, from the sum of labor income, asset income, and transfer payments, we subtract taxes to see what is left (individual income)
	Lorenz Curve
		Graphs cumulative percentage of income (y) against cumulative percentage of households (x)
		Perfect income equality occurs when it is a 45 degree line
			The further the actual curve is from 45 degrees, the more inequality exists
		The Genie (sp?) Coefficient is the result of dividing the area between the perfect equality line and the Lorenz curve by the total area under the perfect equality line
			0 if perfectly equal
			1 if perfectly inequal
		The Lorenz curve does NOT allow for inter-country comparisons
		The US is a good place to be 'impovrished'
	What is Poverty?
		Can be defined in absolute or relative terms
			the U.S. government uses an absolute measurement

Interest, Rent, and Profit: (March 29, 2013)
Interest:
	Loanable funds are the result of savings. 
	If the supply of loanable funds increases, the supply shifts to the right and interest rates decrease 
	In the United States, inflation due to the government printing money willy nilly has pushed interest rates down 
		Some claim the the savings of Baby Boomers is the actual source of the problem 
	Consumers demand loanable funds because they have a positive rate of time preference 
		They want things sooner rather than later 
		This is true for nearly everyone, people differ with respect to the strength of their preference 
	The interest rate is the equilibrium point of supply of and demand for loanable funds 
	Pension funds in the US economy are riding on a bubble because they've been counting on much higher interest rates than they're now receiving 

Companies often use a roundabout method of production 
	Produce or obtain capital equipment then begin to produce their product 
	Interest rate return on capital investment often makes this approach more rewarding than a direct approach in which capital investment is eschewed 
	US foreign aid often takes the form of loans to countries or individuals meant to encourage capital investment 
	Unfortunately, we usually give them the fish instead of the fishing net. We need to give them the capital equipment to enable them to increase their productivity 

The price for loanable funds and the return on capital investments tends towards equality 
	If return on capital is higher, people will borrow more money to invest, thereby increasing demand for loanable funds and subsequently, interest rates 
	Companies will often rank opportunities for investment based on ROI
	Hurdle rate: minimum interest rate that is lower than the highest ROI rate
	The government often pushes down interest rates during a recession to encourage companies to take loans to expand/invest
		Unfortunately, investments in capital often result in less demand for labor, increasing unemployment & decreasing wages
		If rates are pushed too low, banks are likely to simply refuse to make loans (risk outweighs reward)
	
Why do interest rates differ? 
	Risk: Higher risk -> higher interest
	Cost of making loan: administrative overhead results in prohibitive overhead (especially for large institutions), so banks cannot viably make small loans 
	Term of loan: The longer the term, the higher the interest (usually)
	Inflation: Higher inflation rates -> higher interest rates

Real vs. Nominal Interest Rates:
	Real interest is the current rate
	Nominal interest is what you'll be forced to pay for a loan, based on real interest & inflation
	If the real interest rate is 4% and the inflation rate is 3%, then the nominal interest rate is 7%
	RI = 4%, 1% IR, NIR = 5%
	The government could equallize real and nominal interest rates by sending a signal that inflation will not be tolerated
	
Yield curve is effectively a representation of what state people believe the economy will be in in the future
	Upward -> good
	Down -> bad

Present value calculations:
	Present value tells how much a quantity of future money is worth now
		Based on expected interest rates and the amount of time
		
Rent and Profit:
	Economic rent is payment is excess of opportunity cost
		If the supply curve is fixed, then price depends only on demand
		Pure if no opportunity cost
		
Chapter 31: Market Failures (April 5 2013)
Usually, the private market does the best job of selecting quantities and prices for goods for the maximum efficiency.
	However, there are three cases in which case the market fails to maximize efficiency
	Environmental markets, Public goods, Unequal information
	
Environmental economics and externalties:
	Diminishing marginal utility - people consume goods until their untility falls below the cost
		Price and cost send signals that prevent under/over consumption & production
		If these signals are tampered with, problems result
	(Negative) externalities are actions that result in costs being imposed on an independent third party
		Air pollution, noise polution, other forms of pollution
		Results in overcunsumption of natural resources
	If companies don't recognize all costs related to the production of a good, they will produce a quantity above the socially optimal output.
Negative externalities become more pronounced in areas of higher population density
Internalizing Externalties:
	Taxing & Subsidies
		If we have negative externalities (unrecognized costs) the govenment can approximate an appropriate dollar cost and apply it to the product
			government is notorious for miscalculating and moving the output level even farther from socially optimal point
		Subsidies are similar, but applied to positive externalties
	
	Assigning property rights:
		Pollution is often a problem because no one owns air/water
		Government can assign businesses responsibility for caring for resources that they utilize & value
	
	Property Rights combined with Voluntary Agreements
		Coast Theory: In the case of zero or trivial transaction costs, the property rights assignments do not affect resource distribution
			Private sector handles distribution
			Deregulation benefits the market in most situations
Public Goods:
All goods:
	Private goods are rivalrous	
		If one person consumes, no one else can
	Public goods are non-rivalrous
		Consumption by one person does not prevent consumption by others
		Can be excludable or non-excludable
		People can be prevented from enjoying excludable goods
			College classes, movie theaters, plays
		Nonexcludable goods provide blanket benefits
			National defense
			Flood control
			Open radio stations
			Public TV
	Because of the free rider problem (with nonexcludable public goods), the market will often fail to produce them or fail to produce sufficicient quantities

Asymmetric (Unequal) Information
	Occurs when buyers and sellers have (significantly) differing levels of information
		Can occur in both product and factor markets
		In MOST situations, the seller has more information than the buyer
	Used car dealers purchase cars in a symmetric market and resell in an assymetric market for a profit
	Very rarely, buyers are on the winning side of the deal
		Buy a painting cheaply at a garage sale, resold for millions
	
	In a Factor Market:
		Misinformation/exaggeration of perks, excitingness, and other non-pecuniary aspects of a job lead to lower wage rates
			Only knowing the good things, none of the bad

Public Choice & Politics (April 15, 2013)
	Much of the pioneering research in this area was conducted by James Buchannan (not the president)
	Public Choice Theory - People's behavior is solely the result of comparisons of costs & benefits
	People are not Dr.Jeckyl/Mr Hyde
		Nature doesn't change in different circumstances -- behavior may change, but only as a result of changes to costs & benefits
		
	Median Voter Theorem
		Voters prefer the candidate that is closest to their viewpoint
		In a 2-party system, candidates will gravitate towards the middle of the spectrum
			capture the maximum number of voters
		Predictions:
			Candidates will labor their opponents as being too extreme
	
	Simple Majority Voting
		Votes may pass when not socially optimal
			More people support, even if there is less measureable support than not.
		Can't convey strength of support/disagreement through simple votes.
		
Ch. 34: Free Trade (April 17, 2013)
	Trade = imports & exports
	International trade is a massive and vital part of the economy of our lives
		A vast majority of the goods we use were produced outside of the U.S.
		Brock Hall funded by Brock candy company and McKee foods, who bought large amounts of sugar from foreign countries
			Companies teamed up, Brock funded Southern as thanks for cost advantage
	As individuals, we export time, skills, etc, and import goods & services
	The US operates in a trade deficit
		We import more goods than we import
		Not necessarily a bad thing - improves quality of life
		Only bad if it gets out of control
	Choosing what to produce:
		Countries produce various quantities of goods based on opportunity costs & the production possibilities frontier
			Comparative advantage: lower opportunity cost to produce a good
			
	International trade allows all countries involved to consume more than they're capable of producing individually
	
	Consumers' and Producers' Surplus
		The higher one is, the lower the other will be.
		In the US, goods are cheap (high consumer surplus) and corporations (some) are struggling
			Japan is the opposite
	
	Costs & Benefits of Trade Restrictions
		Tariffs (Definitely a graph problem on the test):
